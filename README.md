# 🚧 ROADTRACE – QR-Based Road Transparency & Monitoring System

ROADTRACE is a civic-tech web platform designed to improve transparency and accountability in road infrastructure.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. A QR code is placed near a road.
2. When scanned, it opens a dedicated webpage for that specific road.
3. The page displays:
   - Road Name
   - Area & Ward
   - Responsible Authority
   - Construction & Maintenance Details
4. Citizens can report issues such as:
   - Potholes
   - Surface Damage
   - Waterlogging
5. Complaints are stored in a database.
6. An Admin Dashboard calculates a Road Health Index based on complaint data.
